"""Time surface filter.

This filter constructs a time surface representation of recent events.
At each call to :meth:`process`, it decays the stored intensity
according to an exponential kernel and then boosts the intensity at
pixels where new events occurred.  The result is two floating point
images (for positive and negative polarities) that represent how
recently each pixel fired.  These images may be used to render
fading trails or heatmaps.

The decay is governed by ``tau_ms``, the time constant in
milliseconds.  Intensities are decayed by a factor of
``exp(-dt / tau)`` between successive calls, where ``dt`` is the
elapsed time in microseconds.  Setting ``polarity_separate`` to
``False`` causes both positive and negative events to be accumulated
in the same surface.
